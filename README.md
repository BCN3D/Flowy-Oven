# Flowy Oven
DIY Reflow oven for electronics prototyping.
Here @BCN3DTechnologies we prototype everything quite a lot, and electronics is not an exception.   
That's why we thought we needed a reflow oven. The professional ones are too expensive and we decided to make one by ourselves.   

This Reflow Oven is based on the following projects:
+ [Reflow Oven by Kevin Darrah](http://www.kevindarrah.com/download/arduino_code/ReflowOven_v1.ino)
+ [Reflow Oven by Ben Heck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckcHyMxqesM)

## Bill of Materials - BOM
+ Reclaimed standard home oven. Ours is about 1KW.
+ Arduino Mega 2560. We have a lot of them laying arround.
+ SSR. Solid State Relay.
+ 16x4 LCD Display with encoder to navigate.
+ Thermocouple breakout board. MAX31855 from adafruit.
+ 12V power supply
+ A fan for cooling the electronics and another to move hot air.
+ Main fused switch, cables and connectors.

## Documents
The following list explains what contains each folder.
+ Code: where the `Arduino` code lives. There are also a few examples related to the LCD display and Thermocouple.
+ Datasheets: folder to store the Datasheets related to the project.
+ img: some pictures of the project.
+ Printed Parts: the `CAD` files of the printed parts that we've used to mount the system.
